                    One day in April, 2018, I was asked to help move some equipment for the IT Department of the North Carolina State University
                    Department of Materials Science and Engineering. I was so good at carrying computers and unscrewing hard-drives that I
                    was asked to work on a large software project.
                </div>
                <div>
                    I ended up creating a database and corresponding interface to manage the computers, printers, monitors, etc. (called assets) of the
                    department. The SQL database holds a complex web of tables and the interface, made with HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and javascript,
                    allows for asset data to easily be added, accessed, deleted, and updated. Developed from April to September, 2018, the system
                    now manages thousands of assets and continues to save the MSE Department time and resources.

                    This screenshot is from the end of the development phase, before the code was migrated to NC State's secure servers.
                    George Martell, the IT Manager, taught me SQL and PHP and otherwise helped me throughout the project.

                    From June 26 to July 27, 2018, I interned at the South Korean university Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology
                    Department of Energy Science and Engineering under Professor Su-Il In. I assisted graduate students Saurav Sorcar and Ali
                    Shahzad in their effort to develop a material that uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuel at
                    industrial efficiencies.

                    In a break from my previous experience, I worked in the lab every day, setting up photocatalytic experiments and
                    sythesizing samples. I was able to put my data science skills to use, however, as I wrote an R script to calculate and plot
                    incremental efficiencies and derivitaves of the sample output, data that was an integral part of the paper that I co-authored
                    on the subject.

                    The paper below discusses the results of our reduced blue-titania photocatalyst, sensitized with bimetallic Cu–Pt nanoparticles,
                    and its world-class sustained and peak efficiencies.

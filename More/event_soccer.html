                    I have been playing soccer for as long as I can remember. Soccer has been and continues to be a huge part of my life, teaching me dedication,
                    perseverance, and more valuable lifelong skills. I played for Enloe Menâ€™s Varsity Soccer for all four years of high school and played travel club soccer
                    since 2011 for Triangle FC and North Carolina FC. Before that I played recreational soccer in Pennsylvania and was on a successful 3v3 team.
                    My teams have qualified for, placed in, and won many tournaments over the years.

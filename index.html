                I am a student at Enloe High School in Raleigh, North Carolina. I was born in Lexington, Kentucky, lived in State College,
                Pennsylvania for a while, and now live in Raleigh with my mother, father, sister, dog, and cat. Feel free to look around this website
                for a short introduction to me. A standard resume only sratches the surface of a person, and I hope this 'HTML resume' will allow you to dig a little
                deeper. If you would like a regular resume, you can download a PDF <a href="Keltin/Resume.pdf" style="color: black" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    I am a huge Kentucky basketball fan, and also root for the Pittsburg Steelers. I love to travel, but of all the places I have gone, Lake Tahoe in California
                    is my favorite. You will probably notice quite a few pictures from there, including the one to the right (that is my lovely Aunt next to me). My favorite subject
                    in school has always been math, followed by orchestra.

                I built this website from scratch over a period of about four weeks using HTML, CSS, and javascript. Not only was
                this a fun project for me, but I also learned a lot about web design and coding. w3schools.com was my main resource for various information, including a
                few code snippets. This website is hosted by GitHub and the interactive map is courtesy of amCharts.
